Lesson 2

What Makes a Repository a Respository?
- A repository saves meta-data on the whole history of a set of files. But where is it stored?
- It is stored in a hidden folder that will not show up in most folder explorers (it has a . in front of it)
- Hidden folders are only hidden because they contain data taht users do not need to see most of the time
- ".git"
- To see these files in a directory through the command line, type ls -a
- When you clone a repository, all that data is copies


Initializing a Repository
- Run "git init" to initialize a new repository
- This will create a .git file in a directory, but it will not contain any commits
- 

Examining the New Repository
- "git status" shows which files have changed since the last commit
-
