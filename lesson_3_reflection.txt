Syncing Repositories
- Using GitHub to sync your committed repositories
- You get to choose when to sync. This is important, because it allows you to make multiple commits before they become public.
- The first step is creating an empty repository on GitHub
- This creates a 'remote repository', from which you can 'push' or 'pull' data.
- When you 'push', you do it by branch
- When you push a branch, Git will start with the tip and send each commit that is reachable from the tip that are not already on the GitHub repository
- 

Adding a Remote
- First, create a new repository on GitHub
- Then create a remote through the command line. Run "git remote" to see all current remotes. "git remote -v" for details
- To create a remote, run "git remote add + name + url of repository on GitHub"
- If you only have one remote in a repository, it is standard to name it origin
- To send changes to the remote, run "git push + remte + local branch"

Editing Files on GitHub
- You can also edit files on GitHub itself
